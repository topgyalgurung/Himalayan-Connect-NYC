# Himalayan-Connect-NYC

## Objective: 
Himalayan Connect NYC, a comprehensive and user-friendly website that connects the Himalayan community in New York with essential resources. The platform will act as a one-stop directory, specifically catering to the needs of the Himalayan community.

## Problem statement: 
The Himalayan community in New York faces significant challenges in accessing essential resources such as nonprofit services, legal assistance, immigration support, housing, and job opportunities. The information about these services is often scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult for community members, especially those with limited English proficiency or technological experience, to find the help they need. This lack of a centralized, accessible platform creates barriers to important services, hindering the community’s ability to thrive in a new environment.

By offering a streamlined platform with categorized listings, search functionality, and multilingual support, the project will empower individuals and families to easily find the services they need to succeed.

## Data Sources:
1. Nonprofit and Community Organizations
* Data Sources: Websites like NYC.gov, Charity Navigator, GuideStar, or directly from local nonprofit websites.
* Data Points:
  * Organization name, Contact information (phone, email, address), Services offered Target audience (e.g., specific communities or groups), Operating hours, Website/social media links
2. Community Events and Workshops

* Data Sources: Community centers, nonprofit organizations, social media, and local event boards.
* Data Points: Event name, Date and time, Location, Registration details, Event description

3. Data Integration Considerations:

* Use APIs from sources like Google Maps for geolocation of services.
* Implement web scraping (where legally allowed) to gather data from multiple resources and keep your database updated.
* Allow organizations or individuals to submit data directly through your website.

3. Possible Data Storage:

* Database Options: SQL databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL can store structured data like organizations, contacts, and services. (might use MongoDB since it can work well with more flexible or unstructured data)
* APIs: You can build your own RESTful API to manage this data and keep it organized for easy access on the platform.

## Key Features 

1. Resource Directory: A categorized directory of nonprofit organizations, community services, law firms, immigration resources, jobs, and rental listings tailored for the Himalayan community.
2. Search and Filters: A powerful search function and filters to help users find specific services or organizations quickly.
3. Multilingual Support: Basic support for multiple languages, including Nepali, to cater to the community’s diverse linguistic needs.
